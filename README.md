Hello again.

We can pretend this is something we do often. We can pretend this is something we do well. Today, I object to a common obsession with catharsis, particularly in writing. It follows in my belief, that the acumen of obsession should gravitate toward intellectual curiosity. This is an admonishment to myself--as a person who loves to feel good. In essence, feeling good should only be used strategically to achieve one’s round goal; the general purpose of one’s existence. Obviously these create issues of their own. There’s the question of purpose and how it can be defined in relation to schemas we create. Very tough, very dicey. But if one seeks to decenter feeling good as a prime impulse in the river of motivations, one should carefully consider the possibilities of thorough psychoanalysis.
